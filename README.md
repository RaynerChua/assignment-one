The Potato Lounge (E-commerce Website)

The Potato Lounge is a unique and innovative company based in Singapore, specializing in two distinct offerings: exquisitely designed couches and premium-grade potato products. Our collection of uniquely aesthetic sofas is sourced externally, while our high-quality potato products are crafted in-house and made available for purchase through our online platform.

What sets The Potato Lounge apart is its convenience and exclusivity. Instead of regularly visiting physical stores, customers can effortlessly browse, select, and order their desired furniture or potato products with just a few clicks, enjoying doorstep delivery from the comfort of their homes.

Our chefs take immense pride in crafting potato products of unparalleled quality, far superior to typical supermarket offerings. Guided by a commitment to quality over quantity, The Potato Lounge aspires to attract a growing community of online shoppers, with only 1 physical store, we hope to eventually branch out into more stores across Singapore. ( For those who might prefer shopping in person.)


DESIGN PROCESS

At our store, we specialize in stylish modern couches that enhance any living space. Along with our beautiful furniture, we offer
exclusive branded potato snacks that customers can conveniently add to their purchase. Whether they are looking to elevate their home with a chic couch or simply indulge in delicious snacks, we have something for everyone. We wouldn't want them to miss out on the chance to enjoy the best of both worlds!

Our website caters to individuals who love to relax on a cozy, cushioned couch while enjoying their favorite potato snacks. We hope to provide our customers with premium grade furniture while offering a delicious range of potato products. We outsource several unique types of couches & potatoes that a consumer would typically enjoy for reasonable if not cheaper prices.

Customers can easily navigate the home page & observe our latest arrivals as well as featured snacks internally sourced.

Should they find something of interest the view more option directs them to our product page where they can select their desired items & add them to their cart.

If a customer wants to know more about our company, they can access that history page to find out more.

If I were to put myself in their shoes, I believe that this website can fulfill my needs when it comes to searching for the perfect couch as well as picking out my favourite potato snack on the way. The prices are also reasonable and not blown out of proportion.

FEATURES

Existing Features:

Company logo is center aligned & featured on every page. I designed the logo myself with Adobe illustrator.

There is also a back-to-top button in the bottom right corner of the footer that automatically scrolls all the way up if the user wishes to view new arrivals.

My Cart Page:

Future Features:

I hope I can code it so that customers can directly add the item they want to purchase from the products page into their cart, adjust the quantity & delete it when necessary.

(current code only navigates to cart, products are prelisted with no added functionality.)

Total Price tally feature & proceed to payment function:
All products in the cart will tally up and show the final price alongwith a proceed with payment button that directs users to the payment page.

Payment Page followed up with a generated receipt:
Users can select their payment option, key in their card information & save it for future use. After which they will receive an email notification confirming their receipt.
